      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think that there are a huge number of hills in Lincolnshire. According to the Marvelous Map of Great British Place Names, there is Nob hill, not too far from Poke Holes and Fanny Hands Lane. Unfortunately (for my childish brain), none of these are the highest point in Lincolnshire. Rather, it goes by the grand title of Normanby Le Wold Top (oooh, fancy!).
Some time ago during this hill running challenge, I had run up all of the hills that could realistically be reached from Cambridge (except Northamptonshire - the less said about that the better), without spending more time in the car than on the trails.</description>
