      <description>This post will be brief, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to write it after running up this (Surrey) hill. So I left it for 5 months, right up until our next planned run in a weeks time. I truly am a slave to my own laziness.
It all started the eve of Halloween (ooooh spooooky) 2020. We were heading down to visit my Mum, as the pandemic restrictions now allowed overnight stays, and it was her 60th birthday the previous day.</description>

      <description>What do you do when you&amp;rsquo;re bored in January and live in Cambridge? Answer: drive for 2 hours to fulfill an idiotic challenge to run up an arbitrary number of hills based on a somewhat tenuous definition of a &amp;lsquo;highest point&amp;rsquo;. It just dawned on me that I can&amp;rsquo;t really justify this challenge, other than &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve started so I&amp;rsquo;ll finish&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s genuinely nice that people regularly ask me how the challenge is progressing, but I also get a little bit of a sense of disappointment when I tell them I&amp;rsquo;ve only run up 16/103 hills.</description>
