      <description>Where the heck is Rutland? I hear you ask. Well, according to some, it is the smallest county in England, it holds the largest manmade lake (so basically half of it is a lake) and it is home to the Nurdling World Championships (Nurdling = throwing pennies in a hole), the winners are crowned the ‘best tosser’, no joke.
Based on these facts alone, this was shaping up to be a very exciting run.</description>
